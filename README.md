#+TITLE: Readme

This is where the blog posts written for the (neovim portion) of my website will be developed. The idea is to notify community members of changes in Core, spotlight community plugins, and occasionally solicit feedback.

File an issue if you'd like me to highlight your plugin, or if there is a cool PR (merged or unmerged) against Core or a plugin you'd like to spotlight.

Posts not considered final until on my website.
