# Neorants Issue #1
Thoughts and news from your (not always friendly) neighborhood maintainer

This is the first of what I'm sure will be sporadically delivered and ill-conceived posts on the happening in neovim development. If you want me to write about anything in particular, please file an issue at the repo [repo](https://github.com/mjlbach/neorants)

###News

1. Borders have been added as an option for floating window (by bfredl), and the language server client helper functions have been updated to take advantage of them (by me and elianiva). You can set the color and style of your border however you like (including the color per corner if you want to get crazy).

   I also made the hover handler return the buf id, so you can also set custom keybacks (like having the hover triger also return you back to the original window). See below and `:help nvim_open_win()` for more options on customizing the border.

   ```lua
    vim.cmd [[autocmd ColorScheme * highlight NormalFloat ctermbg=None]]
    vim.cmd [[autocmd ColorScheme * highlight FloatBorder ctermbg=None]]
    local overridden_hover = vim.lsp.with(vim.lsp.handlers.hover, { border = "single" })
    vim.lsp.handlers["textDocument/hover"] = function(...)
        local buf = overridden_hover (...)
        vim.api.nvim_buf_set_keymap(buf, 'n', 'K', '<Cmd>wincmd p<CR>', {noremap = true, silent = true})
    end
   ```

2. Async/await utilities to leverage lua coroutines (cooperating multitasking) was added to Plenary in [PR #83](https://github.com/nvim-lua/plenary.nvim/pull/83), and [PR #709](https://github.com/nvim-telescope/telescope.nvim/pull/709) was merged in Telescope to use async/await for all but live_grep (Yay non-blocking input)

3. There's a bug in luajit that seems to effect protected calls to neovim's json_decode (see [Issue #14246](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/issues/14246)). The safest option, as always, is to clone the neovim git repo and compile directly from source. This assumes you have [installed the pre-reqs](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/wiki/Building-Neovim#build-prerequisites).

   ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/neovim/neovim
    cd neovim
    make clean && make distclean
    make CMAKE_EXTRA_FLAGS="-DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=$HOME/.local/neovim" -j
    sudo make install
    ```

    Unlike AUR, we vendor the luajit version so this build process will not be affected by upstream luajit changes.


###Rants

1. Stop filing issues that say "X doesn't work". I don't know why this happens so often with the language server client in Neovim core, but 90+% of these cases end up being a configuration issue (what are y'all doing in your configs!?). You need to reproduce starting with a minimal neovim config, no core member is going to wade through a 5000 line custom config filled with plugins. I'll be writing a basic "how to apply binary search to configurations to write a good github issue" guide soon-ish.

2. Stop filing pull requests to change CONFIG.md in lspconfig, it's autogenerated, you need to change the source file from which is derived.

3. There is basically 0 reason to rewrite your init.vim as an init.lua. I feel partly responsible for starting this crusade, but it's spiralled. There's no speedup unless you're writing tons of custom, expensive functions in your vim config. The only reason I do it is because I write a lot of lsp extensions/handler overrides in my config when debugging, and I like having a good language server to check them for correctness.

###Things to look forward to

1. [PR #12593](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/pull/12593) I'm really excited about having a built-in mechanism for file-change detection in neovim. There are a lot of cool things, particular in regards to sending file-change detection events to language servers.
2. [PR #14122](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/pull/14122) Semantic highlighting (think Semshi) is something a lot of people seem to care about. It's part of the LSP spec, but currently not implemented in core. This PR by Smolck changes that.
3. I wrote a terrible plugin called [Babelfish]( https://github.com/mjlbach/babelfish.nvim). Most of it was done between the hours of 1AM and 3AM on a Friday night after a conference deadline. I plan on working on it intermittently, but TLDR I want to never have to write vim documentation again (It's a Markdown to Vim Documentation converter using tree-sitter).
